#  Limanski
Limanski is a mathcad-like engine built within HTML5 canvas for easy use & share of mathematical and engineering calculations, focused on ease-of-use, extensibility and adoptability, named in honor of our beloved prof. Limanski

## Building
The build directory must contain `index.html` and all the transpiled js files (placed automatically by running `tsc`).
### Windows 
For Windows users, simply run a local server at port `5500` and run `.\build.ps1` via powershell.
### Linux
For Linux users, run a local server and execute `./build.sh`. Default port is `5500`, but you can change it by passing argument like this: `./build 8080`
